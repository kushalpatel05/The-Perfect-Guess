# Number Guessing Game 
A simple Python project where the user tries to guess a random number between **1 and 100**.

## How It Works
- The program generates a random number using `random.randint(1, 100)`.
- The user keeps guessing until they get it right.
- Hints are provided:
  - 🔼 “Higher number please...”
  - 🔽 “Lower number please...”
- The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

## Concepts Used
- `random.randint()` function
- Conditional Loop
